# Server Installation

[Hint: In OS X most of these are available via homebrew. In Unix environments a package manager such as aptitude will do the same.]

1) Configure addresses and keys as needed. A list with file names and line numbers can be obtained by running (in the "src" directory):

    $ grep -nH 'INIT_CONFIG' *.lisp

2) Install a Java servlet. Our system has been running on jetty-8.1.11.v20130520.

3) Get Sesame. From the Sesame package, copy "openrdf-sesame.war" and "openrdf-workbench.war" to directory "libexec/webapps" under Jetty. Test run Jetty by running (in the Jetty libexec directory):

    $ java -jar start.jar

If everything is ok, using a browser to open "http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/repositories/NONE/repositories" (in the same machine, otherwise substitute "localhost" with the server address) should bring up the Sesame Workbench.
[Hint: Jetty stops by pressing Ctrl-C.]

4) Install SBCL.

5) Install Quicklisp.

6) ASDF is also needed. Nowadays it is bundled with SBCL, but at least lately on Linux systems it has required activation. Run sbcl:
    $ sbcl
Load the module with:
    * (require "asdf")
This line should return: ("ASDF"). Make sure it is the latest version by using asdf to load itself:
    * (asdf:load-system :asdf)
Should return: T. SBCL can now be exited with (quit)

7) Confirm that the home folder of the project is configured. Under the current home directory, find (or make) directory: ~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d
In source-registry.conf.d create file: "spire.conf" with the path to the cloned "src" directory:
---
(:directory "~/xx/yy/spire-server/src/")
---]

8) Run SBCL and type:

    * (asdf:load-system :spies)
[ A lot of style warnings follow. ]

    * (hunchentoot:start (make-instance 'hunchentoot:easy-acceptor :port 4242)) 

This should return the following object:
    #<HUNCHENTOOT:EASY-ACCEPTOR (host *, port 4242)>

At this point "spire.address.com:4242" should respond to a browser and the server should be happily up and running.

If loading :spies complains about missing drakma / hunchentoot / cs-json, they can be loaded like this:
    * (asdf:load-system :drakma)
    * (asdf:load-system :hunchentoot)
    * (asdf:load-system :cl-json)
